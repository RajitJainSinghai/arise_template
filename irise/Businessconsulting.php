        <div class="discovery">
        <h1 id="Discovery">1. Discovery</h1>
        <p>The first step is the discovery phase, where the goal is to learn about our client business. It takes time to learn as much as possible about a business from the owner and employees and will do the following things:</p>
        
        <li>Tour your facilities.</li>
        <li>Meet with the board of directors and employees</li>
        <li>Analyze your company's finances</li>
        <li>Read all company materials.</li>


        <h1 id="Evaluation">2. Evaluation</h1>
        <p>Once we have developed an in-depth understanding of client company, we enter the evaluation phase, with the goal to identify where change is needed. This phase includes identifying your company’s strengths and weaknesses as well as current and foreseeable problems.</p>

        <li>Examining established problems and identifying new problems: The consultant should study problems that owners and management have already identified. Because of their objectivity, consultants can also pinpoint new or unforeseen issues.</li>

        <li>Finding solutions: A business consultant should strategize solutions to the problems they identify and outline ways to capitalize on opportunities to grow the business, increase profits, and boost efficiency. For example, say your company has a particularly strong sales department but a weak marketing department. This is an opportunity to increase your marketing resources and capitalize on your sales staff.</li>

        <h5 id="making_margin">There are two crucial elements to focus on during this process: communication and feedback.</h5>
        <li>Communication: During the evaluation phase, your entire team must maintain clear, open communication with the consultant. </li>

        <li>Feedback: You and your team members should take the business consultant’s advice as constructive criticism. The consultant’s feedback isn’t meant to be personal. While you and your employees are personally close to the business, this lack of wider perspective can hinder positive change and growth; the consultant brings objectivity and a fresh viewpoint. Of course, you should offer your own feedback and opinions to the business consultant, but keep your mind open to new ideas.</li>


        <h1 id="Implementation">3. Implementation</h1>
        <p>Once your company and the consultant agree on a plan, the consultant should enter the third phase: the restructuring stage, or implementation of the plan. In this phase, the consultant builds on your assets and eliminates liabilities. They also monitor the plan’s progress and adjust it as needed.</p>
